# FDA Recalls

In this project for my Programming in Journalism class, I practiced web scraping, using an API service, and basic data wrangling skills.  

I created a data pipeline that scrapes FDA announcements on medical device recalls, performs entity extraction on specific text from each recall announcement using the OpenCalais/Refinitiv Intelligent Tagging API, and creates a CSV file listing these extracted entities.
